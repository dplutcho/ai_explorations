# AI Explorations
Welcome to AI Explorations, a collection of Jupyter notebooks and code snippets that will document my journey through learning various aspects of AI centered around Taxonomies, classification, and semantics.
I am a longtime Taxonomist and an AI practitioner and strategist at [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/) I am also the host of the [TWIML generative_ai discussion group](https://twimlai.com/community/program/generative-ai/) where I have facilitated NLP and AI discussions for going on four years.

About This Repository
