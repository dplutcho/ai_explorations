    "# KW eval - precision\n",
    "* Inspired by [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)\n",
    "* Utilizing GPT-4 prompt eval for keyword extraction precision.\n",
    "* Key point is this is all done without any golden set or human annotation..\n",
    "* KeyBert scores 0.5 precision - however this is whithout and cut off set.\n",
    "* GPT4 using a very simple prompt scores 0.786 (cut off is not applicable).\n",
    "* Next steps include implementing a recall and F1 score then perhaps some other new custom score of some sort.\n",
    "* Once there are in place it will be interesting to test various KW extraction prompts and see how they perform.\n",
    "* The biggest drawback of this type of evaluation is it's slow and perhaps can be expensive. Perhaps finetuning an opensource model may resolve this in the near future.\n",
    "* Also, while I was able to get the precision prompt to work reasonably well it is difficult to instruct it to do exactly what I want in the evaluation."

    "kw_precision_prompt = \"\"\"Given a document and proposed keywords, identify the good and bad keywords following these steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "* start by generating the main keyword phrases following the below guidlines.\n",
    "* Compare the proposed keywords with the generated keywords.\n",
    "* Mark as good any keywords that are very close matches and for these good:\"yes\"\n",
    "* Read the guidlines <guidlines>.\n",
    "* Use the guildines to determine which proposed keywords are good vs bad.\n",
    "* Take a breadth and reevaluate your decisions to make sure they are correct.\n",
    "* Return the results of your consternation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<guidlines>\n",
    "General:\n",
    "In some cases, all keywords will be bad. If there aren't any good keywords that fully conform to all guidelines then reject all of them. Make sure all proposed keywords are concise, clear, and unambiguous keywords rather than phrases or fragments. You must compare each keyword to the ideal keyword that should be assigned to this document using the guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Good Keywords for Document Classification:\n",
    "- Relevance: They should directly relate to the core content or theme of the document. Relevant keywords ensure that the document is correctly categorized and easily retrievable. When assigning keywords, ensure they reflect the primary focus and recurring themes of the document, rather than isolated incidents or secondary details.\n",
    "- Contextual Relevance: Ensure the keywords capture the main theme or unique aspects of the document. They should reflect the core message or the most significant information presented. For instance, if the document discusses the impact of vermin on grain stocks, a keyword like \"vermin impact on agriculture\" would be contextually relevant.\n",
    "- Specificity: Keywords should be specific enough to distinguish the document's unique aspects. Generic terms may lead to misclassification or difficulty in locating the document among numerous others. Choose keywords that are specific to the content of the document. Avoid broad or generic terms that could apply to many different contexts.\n",
    "- Consistency: Using standardized terms within a given classification system or subject area promotes uniformity. This aids in linking similar documents and facilitates systematic retrieval.\n",
    "- Clarity: Keywords should be clear and unambiguous. This minimizes confusion and ensures that users with different levels of expertise or background knowledge can understand and use them effectively.\n",
    "- Comprehensiveness: They should cover all major themes or topics in the document. This ensures that the document can be found under all relevant searches.\n",
    "- Conciseness: While being comprehensive, keywords should also be concise, avoiding overly long or complex phrases that may not be commonly used or searched for.\n",
    "- Predictive Power: Good keywords anticipate the terms users might use when searching for that type of document, aligning with potential search queries.\n",
    "- Balance Specificity with Breadth: While being specific, also ensure that the keywords are not so narrow that they miss other important aspects of the document. They should collectively provide a balanced overview of the document’s content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Bad Keywords for Document Classification:\n",
    "- Too Broad or Vague: Keywords that are overly general can lead to a document being lost among too many irrelevant search results, making it hard to locate.\n",
    "- Too Obscure or Technical: Using highly specialized or niche terms that are not widely recognized can make a document inaccessible to a broader audience.\n",
    "- Irrelevant: Keywords that don't accurately reflect the document's content can mislead users and result in poor retrieval accuracy.\n",
    "- Inconsistent Usage: Using different terms for the same concept across documents can lead to fragmentation and difficulty in retrieving all relevant documents on a topic.\n",
    "- Redundancy: Overlapping or repetitive keywords add no value and can clutter the classification system. Avoid Redundancy. Don't use multiple keywords that convey the same idea. Each keyword should add new information or a different perspective on the document's content.\n",
    "- Ambiguity: Ambiguous terms can lead to misinterpretation and misclassification, especially in documents covering multiple topics.\n",
    "- Too Lengthy: Long phrases or sentences used as keywords can complicate the search process and are often overlooked in favor of shorter, more direct terms. Choose keywords that unambiguously relate to the document’s content. Avoid words that have multiple meanings or could be easily misinterpreted out of context.\n",

      "  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\n",
      "  Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in\n",
      "  Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection\n",
      "  with their pact to stabilise currencies.\n",
      "      Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why\n",
      "  the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson\n",
      "  replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\"\n",
      "  When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float\n",
      "  with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not\n",
      "  want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not\n",
      "  to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord.\n",
      "      Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual\n",
      "  countries would take corrective action if their currency began\n",
      "  reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.\n",
      "      But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,\n",
      "  Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid\n",
      "  through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.\n",
      "      \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having\n",
      "  difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate\n",
      "  appreciations and making their economies more domestically\n",
      "  oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to\n",
      "  make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said.\n",
      "      In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury\n",
      "  Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's\n",
      "  current level, adding that \"It is an objective ... To try to\n",
      "  keep it around that level.\"\n",
      "      He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had\n",
      "  changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the\n",
      "  pound had weathered that period so successfully. \"There has been\n",
      "  a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,\" Lawson said.  He\n",
      "  disagreed with what he termed \"the grossly exaggerated claim\"\n",
      "  that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of\n",
      "  other major industrialsed countries.\n",
      "      Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank\n",
      "  rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real\n",

      "  only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.\n",
      "      Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the\n",

      "      He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at\n",
